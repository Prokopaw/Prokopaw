👋 Hi, I’m @Prokopaw

Passion is a driver for change. For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in technical issues. Learning new tools and their use in data       analysis is what I have always liked to bring to the team. I approach challenges with enthusiasm and focus on proactively looking for solutions. Optimizing planning processes requires not only knowledge, but a creative approach. I believe that Python is the perfect tool for someone who wants to broaden their horizons in the field of analytics and working with data. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Python and MySql
💞️ I’m looking to work on Python projects
